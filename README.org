* SovereignWorldbuilding
SovereignWorldbuilding is a personal project built using Django. It
aims to replicate the structure of the Infinity Engine games in a
text-based, wiki format.

It provides interfaces to create Projects, write Campaigns, Worlds, Items,
... and displays your pages in a friendly, easy to navigate way.
